# Drought-Prone Areas in Sudan and Nearby Rivers

In Sudan, several drought-prone areas could be revitalized by utilizing nearby rivers or seasonal water sources. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of some key dry areas and their proximity to rivers or seasonal watercourses:

## 1. Darfur Region:
- **Dry Areas**: Darfur, particularly North Darfur, is severely affected by drought and desertification.
- **Nearby Rivers**:
  - **Seasonal Wadis**: The area is crossed by several seasonal wadis (dry riverbeds), which only flow during the rainy season, such as Wadi Azum. These could potentially be revitalized by introducing water pipelines to provide a more consistent flow.
  - **Wadi Howar**: In northern Darfur, this large wadi was once an active river but is now seasonal. It could be a key area for revitalization with additional water input.

## 2. Eastern Sudan (Kassala Region):
- **Dry Areas**: The region around Kassala experiences seasonal drought, but it's close to potential water sources.
- **Nearby Rivers**:
  - **Gash River**: This is a seasonal river that floods during the rainy season (June to September). It forms a temporary delta near Kassala, and infrastructure could be developed to store and distribute this water throughout the dry season.
  - **Atbara River**: A tributary of the Nile, the Atbara River passes near Kassala. It could be a more permanent source for water pipelines to support agriculture and greenery in the region.

## 3. Northern Sudan (Near the Nile):
- **Dry Areas**: Areas in northern Sudan, particularly near the Nubian Desert, are dry and semi-arid.
- **Nearby Rivers**:
  - **Nile River**: Northern Sudan is adjacent to the Nile River, especially around Dongola and Wadi Halfa. Revitalizing the desert near the Nile using pipeline-fed water could provide immense agricultural benefits.

## 4. Kordofan Region:
- **Dry Areas**: North Kordofan and South Kordofan are drought-prone, semi-arid regions.
- **Nearby Rivers**:
  - **Seasonal Wadis**: This region is intersected by several wadis, which flow intermittently during the rainy season. These watercourses could be revived by bringing in additional water from nearby permanent or seasonal rivers.
  - **White Nile**: The White Nile flows nearby, and its water could potentially be distributed via pipelines into drier areas of North Kordofan for agriculture and landscape regeneration.

## 5. Tokar Delta (Red Sea State):
- **Dry Areas**: The area surrounding the Tokar Delta is arid, with limited rainfall outside the rainy season.
- **Nearby Rivers**:
  - **Baraka River**: The Tokar Delta is fed by the Baraka River, which flows seasonally. The delta and nearby regions could benefit from a more controlled water release to support year-round agriculture.

## Potential Revitalization Strategy:
- **Storage and Distribution**: In most of these areas, water availability is highly seasonal. A strategy of capturing excess water during the rainy season from rivers like the Gash River, Atbara River, and Nile tributaries, and then slowly distributing it via pipelines throughout the year, could rejuvenate the landscape.
- **Seasonal to Permanent Flow**: By using infrastructure to maintain a small, continuous flow in dried-up wadis, the landscapes in these areas could be transformed into agricultural zones or reforested, improving food security and livelihoods.

## Conclusion:
Regions like **Darfur**, **Kassala**, **Northern Sudan**, **Kordofan**, and areas near the **Tokar Delta** all have significant potential for revitalization through water pipelines connecting seasonal rivers, wadis, or major water sources like the Nile. With proper water management and infrastructure, these drought-affected areas could benefit from **year-round water access**, transforming dry, arid landscapes into fertile, green zones.
